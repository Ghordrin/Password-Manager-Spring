Spring Password Manager (Security/Bootstrap)

This is a password manager written in Spring. It has Spring Security for login and bootstrap for general CSS.
Each user has their own vault and each vault has passwords. Currently they aren't encrypted. Not in the database, not on
the application itself. Will be added later.

This is one of my first projects in Spring so I highly suggest that, if you decide to use parts of this code, that you double
check it first. Everything works (creating a new user, checking if the username already exists in the database, login and adding
passwords to the list). 


TODO:
- Add password validation for both creating a user and storing website passwords
- Encrypt passwords into database and retrieve them decrypted to display on the application
- Clean up CSS 


If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me. I'm still learning
